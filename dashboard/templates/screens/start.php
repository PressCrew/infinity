	<h2>Welcome to Infinity</h2>

	<p>
		We can't tell you how happy we are to finally show a select group of people
		from the WordPress Community what we've been working on for the last year.
		What started out small, has quickly evolved into something much bigger,
		something we are very proud of. We hope that you feel the same after trying
		Infinity yourself.

	<h3>
		60 Second Primer (for the impatient hacker)
	</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>The first rule of Infinity, don't touch Infinity itself! (Unless you are just playing around)</li>
		<li>Always extend Infinity with a child theme, and activate that child theme.</li>
		<li>Create the identical path/to/file to extend and/or override it.</li>
		<li>The best place to start poking around is the config/ dir.</li>
		<li>Don't get caught up in the boring templates. They are built for flexibility, not fancy (that is your job).</li>
		<li>Infinity is extrememly powerful. It does more than you can imagine. Don't bail early.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Features that work NOW</h3>

	<p>
		Unless otherwise noted, none of the features require any PHP code to be written.
