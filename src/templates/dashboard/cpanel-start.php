<h2>Welcome to the Infinity family!</h2>

<p>
	Infinity is a powerful theme which, although it works great for any WordPress site, specializes
	in supporting the BuddyPress plugin and many other BuddyPress related plugins. It can function as a parent
	theme, or can be easily forked to build your own custom theme.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is the only known theme which natively supports Commons In A Box (CBOX), and in fact,
	the official default CBOX theme is built on top of Infinity. Because of this relationship, no less than
	three BuddyPress core developers have made contributions to Infinity, in addition to several other current
	and former BuddyPress core contributors.

<h3>
	60 Second Primer (for the impatient hacker)
</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The first rule of Infinity, don't touch Infinity itself! (Unless you are just playing around)</li>
	<li>Always extend Infinity with a child theme, and activate that child theme.</li>
	<li>Create the identical path/to/file to extend and/or override it.</li>
	<li>Don't get caught up in the boring templates. They are built for flexibility, not fancy (that is your job).</li>
	<li>Infinity is extrememly powerful. It does more than you can imagine. Don't bail early.</li>
</ul>
